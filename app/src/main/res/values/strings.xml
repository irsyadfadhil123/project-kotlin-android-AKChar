    <string-array name="data_char_profile">
        <item>A medical personnel from Lees Detective Agency recommended by Mr. Lee, Aak was a well-known underground doctor operating in the gray zones of Lungmen. After joining, he proved to be a tremendous wellspring of medical knowledge and theory with the clinical experience to back it up, though his style of practice is rather worrying. However, based upon Dr. Kaltsits comprehensive evaluation, he was recommended on a provisional basis to the medical equipment department and technological development team.</item>
        <item>Chongyue, the elder brother of landship residents Nian, Dusk, and Ling. He has a close relationship with government organizations such as the Yanese Ministry of War and the Sui Regulator. Previously served as a martial arts instructor at the nomadic city Yumen, a position which he has resigned from. He came to Rhodes Island to visit his family, and after a round of audits, he is temporarily residing onboard the landship as a visitor. Chongyue possesses rich combat experience and has provided Rhodes Island his unique combat suggestions. However, as requested by Dr. Kaltsit, Chongyue rarely participates in missions directly.</item>
        <item>Ebenholz, a Leithanien commoner who became infected with Oripathy during the Vyseheim incident. Introduced to Rhodes Island for treatment by Operator Hibiscus, he demonstrates an extraordinary talent for Originium Arts. Following examinations, he joined Rhodes Island as a field operator.</item>
        <item>Executor, professional statutory executor of the Laterano Notarial Hall, is entitled to the privileges listed in Clauses 1 through 13 of the Laterano Constitution and has been personally granted the title of Saint by the current Lateran Pope Yvangelista XI. Laterano has not placed any restrictions on Rhodes Islands contact with this Saint, and the rapport between us and the Notarial Hall continues to grow. He continues to provide services to Rhodes Island in accordance with his contract, while performing tasks pertaining to the rights of Lateran citizens.</item>
        <item>Former CTO of Karlan Trade. Joined Rhodes Island as an operator via special agreement between Karlan Trade and Rhodes Island. Directed a multitude of core technological developments as well as planned industrial facilities for Karlan Trade; he also did in-depth research on Originium during his time there. Currently a member of Rhodes Islands principal laboratory, working on cutting-edge research.</item>
        <item>Hellagur once belonged to the Ursus Imperial Guard. He is the acting manager of Azazel, an underground clinic for the Chernobog infected. All other relevant work experience has been lost. His mature knowledge of military theoretical systems and his ability in combat make him suitable for a vast majority of combat operations. He is currently in an agreement to be stationed at Rhodes Island, where he provides tactical support.</item>
        <item>The early career of former Sarkaz mercenary captain Hoederer is unclear. He participated in the transfer of Babel as part of the guard detail, leaving after Babel was dismantled. He was then spotted at Chernobog alongside Ines and W as a mercenary hired by Reunion, before disappearing after the Chernobog Incident. His next appearance was as a member of the Military Commission in Londinium. After obtaining certain key information, Hoederer left them and reestablished contact with Rhodes Island, once again signing a memorandum of strategic cooperation with us after discussions with Amiya.</item>
        <item>Private investigator, and founder of Lees Detective Agency. Lee first encountered Rhodes Island during its expansion into Lungmen, and the two parties formed a business relationship thereafter. Has both provided information and consultation services on local Lungmen affairs, as well as recommended talents to Rhodes Island.</item>
        <item>Lessing Maeyer is an auditing student at Leithaniens Ludwigs-Universität who came to Rhodes Island with Ebenholz. He has signed a memorandum of cooperation with us, taking on the code name Lessing and assisting Rhodes Island with operations within Leithanien.</item>
        <item>Logos, elite caster operator, Arts master, and young mistress of the Convallis of the Banshees. Participated in the Kazdel Civil War as one of Babels core members, and became one of the first elite operators of Rhodes Island. He is credited with establishing the standards and procedures for assessing an operators Originium Arts assimilation, the definitive benchmark for predicting future Arts potential.</item>
        <item>Lumen, on the recommendation of Elysium and Kaltsit, is now working as a Rhodes Island operator in Iberia, helping render medical aid to Infected persons in Iberias territories. Additionally, Lumen will also participate in joint meetings between Rhodes Island, Ægir, and the Inquisition, offering suggestions based on his own perspectives and working with all parties to find a possibility of mutual aid in the face of future contingencies.</item>

    <string-array name="data_char_story">
        <item>The Feline underground doctor codenamed Aak was the son of a renowned doctor. However, an insidious plot against his father following a clinical incident forced the family to flee underground. His father tragically died during a gang fight some time later. Aak then decided to become a doctor himself, but he became a notorious gangster doctor instead. After another gang fight, he was recommended by Ko Hei-sing, a.k.a. Hung, to join Lees Detective Agency.</item>
        <item>As the eldest of all siblings of Sui the Yanese Feranmut, Shuo was the first who obtained human conscience following His fragmentation and sought to find his meaning of life in the mortal realm. While witnessing countless wars and bloodshed, he was also amazed by Yans age-old vicissitude that still retains the empires might. To seek the true meaning of wu, whether it be a conflict for war or martial arts for peace, he concealed his Feranmut nature inside his magical sword, remodeling his body into that of a mortal man under the name Chongyue, a pseudonym given by his deceased comrade and an elegy describing his eternal mission and his amazement at the mortal realm.</item>
        <item>The black-haired Caprinae with spiral horns known as Graf Franz von Urtica is the only surviving descendant (though a distant relative) of the evil Witch King of Leithanien. He lost his parents amidst a purge following the Witch Kings downfall and then got kidnapped by the Kings loyalists. To recreate the power of the Witch King and even attempt to resurrect him, they forcefully implanted the young boys head with one of the Witch Kings dark legacies, the accursed Voice of Terra that is said to possess the Witch Kings consciousness. He was nonetheless saved by the Twin Empresses, granted mercy by them out of pity, and groomed to inherit some nobility titles.</item>
        <item>Federico Giallo is the son of a couple of civil servants of the Laterano Notarial Hall who unfortunately died in a mission fifteen years ago (Terran year 1084). Luckily, the young boy was then taken in by Marcello and Luciana Giallo, the former of which is his fathers cousin, and stayed together with his cousin Arturia for a short while. Nevertheless, his stay left an unforgettable memory in his lifetime as he witnessed the awakening of Arturias emotional amplification Arts, which led to the unfortunate tragedy of Luciana and, later on, Arturias downfall. Upon becoming an executor of the Notarial Hall, he swore to himself he would be the only one who apprehends Arturia as his cousin went astray in her quest for the meaning of emotion that eventually led to her quiet collaboration with the Witch Kings Remnants.</item>
        <item>Gnosis Edelweiss comes from a family who had long served the Silverashes of Kjerag as their archive keepers and had been a childhood playmate of young Enciodes. However, his parents were accused of the death of Enciodes parents who intended to reform the country, even though it was actually plotted by the Browntails and Paleroches. Despite their guilt, Enciodes not only forgave him but also worked together with him to found the famed Karlan Trade during their study in Victoria where he uses his excellent skill as a strategist to run the company. But his mild extremism caused the remaining two families of the Three-House Parliament to be impatient with K.C., which forced Enciodes to fire him for his safety. In the meantime, Gnosis continued to carry out his show so that Enciodes could have an excuse to get rid of the two families and the Vine-Bear Court. He would not be hesitant to become the bad guy.</item>
        <item>Hellagur is a famous Ursine war veteran of the ancient Hippogryph Liberi bloodline and a brother-in-arms of Buldrokkastee. Since his youth, Hellagur had participated in numerous wars involving Ursus, such as the Battle of the Four Emperors and the 10th Ursus-Kazimierz War, facing the Silverlance Pegasi in the latter. However, his life is marred with two major traumas caused by betrayals. During the Bloodpeak Campaign, Hellagur was forced to kill his close friend who turned out to be a Higashinese commander. Even though the Higashinese entrusted his daughter Neon and his odachi, the Kudarikiri, the traumatic event as well as his Oripathy eventually led to his retirement and him running the Azazel Clinic, an underground Infected clinic, with another close friend. In his second trauma, the latter collaborated with Neon to plot a betrayal against Hellagur. In order to protect the local patients, Hellagur was once again forced to face another life-and-death situation that cost the betrayers life and bitterly forgave his adopted daughter due to the promise he made to his dead comrade.</item>
        <item>Hoederer is a Sarkaz mercenary who was active during the most recent civil war in Kazdel, working alongside W and Ines as a second lieutenant. His loyalty to the former Sarkaz King Theresa led to his service in Babel; after its fall, he was absorbed into the Military Commission of Kazdel. Under the Regents order, he led his mercenaries to join the newly-formed Reunion Movement. So far, most of his past remains unknown other than the fact that he has a family whose fate remains uncertain.</item>
        <item>A laid-back Lung hailing from the Jiangdong region of Yan, Mr. Lee was originally a member of a merchant family who, owing to his carefree attitude, decided to leave his hometown and settle in Lungmen. Not only he familiarized himself with the underground world of Lungmen, but also founded his own detective agency capable of settling conflicts in the city. In the process, he took care of his step-niece Waai Fu, the daughter of his missing friend Tianpei, brought Aak under his care after his fathers tragic death in a gang fight, and hired Hung when he was fired by his company. Gradually and eventually, Lees Detective Agency became something of Lees own close-knit family.</item>
        <item>Lessing Maeyer the Leithanian Caprinae was born from House Maeyer, a lesser noble family who are subordinates to Graf von Urtica, one of which is the infamous Witch King. Upon acceding to the Leithanian throne, the Witch King ended House Maeyers subordination to Graf von Urtica, although they continue to oversee the Grafschaft (county) of Urtica in the Witch Kings absence.</item>
        <item>Logos is a unique Sarkaz caster. Not only is he a male Banshee, a rare sight within the sub-race, but he was also appointed to be the successor of the Banshee Lord at a young age. His Originium Arts is oral-type, allowing him to cast it by simply speaking or writing with his bone pen. He can bend established laws simply by using his Arts or put curses into devices so no unauthorized access can be done. This makes him the one of the most powerful Operator among Rhodes Islands Elite Operators. Logos Arts has been described as beautiful by others and even the enemies admitted this. Its also noted that Logos is the first Banshee Sarkaz to ever been born outside Kazdel. Logos has said he refuses to ever blow his bone-whistle calling it a lamentable tradition of the Sarkaz Royal Court. He is also a good partner with fellow Elite Operator Mechanist.</item>
        <item>On the outside, the Iberian Islander named Jordi Fontanarossa appears to be a simple nurse serving at the local chapel of Gran Faro. On the flip side, however, he has a noble origin. His parents were once participants of rebuilding the last Eye of Iberia following the Profound Silence that devastated Iberias Golden Age, but unfortunately, they never returned during the last attempt to reach the lighthouse. When the Inquisition started persecuting the local Islanders under the premise of collaboration with the Church of the Deep, he almost became one of the victims without the shelter by the citys mayor Thiago. By the time he matured, all he wished was an undisturbed life from both the Inquisitors and the creepy Seaborn. Still, he is proud of his parents heroic contribution and is always curious what is beyond the Terran seas.</item>

    <string-array name="data_char_overview">
        <item>Aak is a 6★ Geek Specialist who specializes in Support and DPS. Aak is unique among Operators where his HP degenerates (i.e., gradually lost) at a rate of 3% of his maximum HP per second, which can knock him out. Unlike most other Specialists, Aak is classified as a ranged Operator with a ranged attack similar to Marksman Snipers, including a range of 3×3 with a 1×1 extension up front that is extended to 3×4 at Elite 1, which also (somewhat) extends to his stats.</item>
        <item>Chongyue is a 6★ Fighter Guard who specializes in Nuker, and only available from the Festival limited headhunting banners starting from Solitude Universal. Being limited banners, the pity system from other banners are not carried over to every Festival banner, but compensate that, Chongyue has a 70% chance in Solitude Universal and a 30% chance Reap of Millennia to be the 6★ Operator that appears in a pull, and he can be purchased at the Certificate Store for 300 Headhunting Data Contract while a Festival banner starting from Solitude Universal is up.</item>
        <item>Ebenholz is a 6★ Mystic Caster who specializes in DPS. As a Mystic Caster, Ebenholzs attacks deal Arts damage to one target at a time with a range of 2×2 ahead of him with a 1×1 extension up front that is improved to 2×3 ahead of him at Elite 1, as well as very high ATK which is the highest of all Casters, at the expense of a high attack interval almost on par with Splash Casters. When he is not attacking, Ebenholz periodically stores his attacks, up to a maximum of three, and the next time he attacks, all of the stored attacks will be released simultaneously; therefore, should Ebenholz store three attacks, he will attack in a burst of four hits on the next attack, essentially quadrupling the damage dealt.</item>
        <item>Executor is a 5★ Spreadshooter Sniper who specializes in AoE. What defines Executor as a Spreadshooter Sniper is his very short range compared to other Snipers, covering 1×3 ahead of him with a 1×1 extension up front that is improved to 2×3 ahead of him at Elite 1, but his attacks hit all enemies within that short range with the ones on the row in front of him taking 1.5× damage. Executor also has higher HP and DEF than other Snipers, but this is offset by having one of the highest DP costs as well — with a staggering 31 at Elite 1.</item>
        <item>Gnosis is a 6★ Hexer Supporter who specializes in Debuff. As with other Supporters, Gnosis attacks do Arts damage similar to Casters but have a rather unusual range of an adjusted 3×4 (like that of Stopper Supporters at Elite 1) with a 1×2 extension on both sides at Elite 1. Gnosis also has a lower ATK than other Supporters, but his HP and RES are surprisingly higher.</item>
        <item>Hellagur is a 6★ Soloblade Guard who specializes in DPS and Survival. What defines Hellagur as a Soloblade Guard is that he cannot be actively healed by other friendly units (passive healing such as Bard Supporters trait will still heal him); to compensate for this, he will restore some amount of HP in each attack (30 base, 50 at Elite 1, 70 at Elite 2). In addition, Hellagur has high HP and ATK in exchange for low DEF and can only block a single enemy, and his DP cost is staggeringly high, 26 at Elite 2.</item>
        <item>Hoederer is a 6★ Crusher Guard who specializes in DPS. As a Crusher Guard, Hoederers attacks hit multiple enemies equal to his block count in each attack (despite what is stated in-game, Hoederer does not need to block the enemies for his attacks to hit them; the enemies just need to be within his range) like that of Centurion Guards which also extends to his DP cost, but he has much higher HP and ATK in return for being only able to block up to two enemies as well as having a high attack interval and no defenses whatsoever!</item>
        <item>Lee is a 6★ Merchant Specialist who specializes in Fast-Redeploy, Survival, and DPS. As a Merchant Specialist, Lee has a shorter redeployment time of 25 seconds instead of other Operators 70–80 seconds, but the player will lose 3 DP every 3 seconds when Lee is deployed – in other words, freezing the automatic DP generation under normal circumstances or taxes DP generation in operations where the DP generation rate is reduced. Should the player have less than 3 DP when the DP loss is triggered, Lee will be automatically retreated, so it is ill-advised to use him in operations where automatic DP generation is disabled, such as Annihilation and Tactical Drill. Furthermore, Lee does not return DP when retreated; to offset this, he has a low base DP cost of 7 at Elite 1 and maximum Potential.</item>
        <item>Lessing is a 6★ Dreadnought Guard who specializes in DPS and the welfare Operator of Zwillingstürme im Herbst, obtained by acquiring the first Lessings Folder with his Potential being improved by obtaining additional Folders, all of which can be obtained through each of the Covert Visitations in Herzenfolgen.</item>
        <item>Logos is a 6★ Core Caster who specializes in DPS. As a Core Caster, Logos attacks deal Arts damage to one target at a time with moderate ATK and attack interval, and a range of 3×3 with a 1×1 extension up front at Elite 1, having a moderate DP cost.</item>
        <item>Lumen is a 6★ Therapist Medic who specializes in Healing and Support, and the welfare Operator of Stultifera Navis, obtained from the Treasure on Gran Faros Corridor to the Control Room which requires the player to clear SN-4 with Lumens Token available at the Bitterscale Tavern for 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 Rusted Compass.</item>
